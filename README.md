# Policy-Reminder
This is an automation application to remind my family about the maturing life insurance policies

Data Folder contains the policy data which the program reads and performs the activities:
  If maturity date of policy is less than 60 and greater than 0 from the current date then it sends a message to the customers reminding them of the policy maturity with other policy details

  This project is intended for personal use now, and will probably be hosted on some free Python hosting services. Then it would be scheduled for running daily at a specific time for the message to reach the customers.
